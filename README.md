Machine Learning Assignment - Tutorial about Gradient Boosting

This project demonstrates how Gradient Boosting, a powerful ensemble learning technique, can be applied to a real-world classification problem using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.
The goal is to help students and beginners understand:

What Gradient Boosting is

Why it often outperforms single decision trees

How model performance improves through hyperparameter tuning

How to evaluate results using accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices

All code is written in Python using scikit-learn


How to Run

Upload the notebook to Google Colab

Install dependencies (if needed):

pip install scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn


Run each cell step-by-step

Review the final performance metrics and visualizations
